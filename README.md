CLUSTERING!! The method of identifying similar groups of data in a dataset is called clustering.
K-MEANS CLUSTERING is a popular algorithm.In these models, the no. of clusters required at the end have to be mentioned beforehand, which makes it important to have prior knowledge of the dataset. These models run iteratively to find the local optima.
These are iterative clustering algorithms in which the notion of similarity is derived by the closeness of a data point to the centroid of the clusters
